# Keycloak Sign-In

Using this module, users can directly log in or register with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) credentials at this HumHub installation.

A new button "Keycloak" (which can be renamed) will appear on the login page.

## Features

- OpenID Connect
- Optionally, always sign in with Keycloak (the login page redirects to Keycloak)
- Keycloak Back-channel logout (1)
- Possibility to add a page in account settings allowing users to change their Keycloak password
- Users synchronization from Keycloak (hourly and with the console command `php yii auth-keycloak/sync-users`): HumHub accounts are created, updated, and deactivated when disabled or removed on Keycloak
- Attribute mapping (Keycloak user attributes to the HumHub username and profile fields), and the console command `php yii auth-keycloak/show-user` to display all the attributes of a Keycloak user
- Keycloak API access with an admin user or with the service account of the client (no password, "Direct access grants" not required)
- Read-only API user support (only the `view-users`, `query-groups` and `view-realm` roles of the `realm-management` client are required)
- Users' groups and email synchronization between Keycloak and HumHub in both directions (2):
    - HumHub to Keycloak sync is done in real time
    - Keycloak to HumHub sync is done once a day
    - HumHub subgroups are synced with the first level of Keycloak subgroups

(1) Allows removing user sessions automatically when signing out from Keycloak (via a websocket).

(2) E.g., when a user on HumHub becomes member of a group the module will:
1. check if a group with the same name exists on Keycloak
2. create the group on Keycloak if not exists
3. add this group to the corresponding user on Keycloak

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or later
- [PHP `allow_url_fopen`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php#ini.allow-url-fopen) must be enabled
- PHP extensions: `MBString`, `JSON` and `BCMath` or `GMP`
- Depending on the algorithms you're using, other PHP extensions may be required (e.g. OpenSSL, Sodium). Full details: https://web-token.spomky-labs.com/introduction/pre-requisite
- For users' groups and email synchronization: on Keycloak, users attributes must be writable (it can be tested by changing the email address of a user on Keycloak administration).

## Configuration

Go to module's configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> Keycloak Auth -> Configure`. And follow the instructions.

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for the Keycloak setup (client, API access with a service account or an admin user, roles) and [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md) for the features (users sync, groups sync, console commands).

## Pricing

This module is free, but the result of a lot of work for design and maintenance over time.
